          			<p>In photography, exposure is everything.  The absorption of light by the sensor is the key to photography's namesake - that is, photo "light" graphy "writing" - by capturing light, we capture the world around us.  However, through skillful use of the camera, we can capture light, motion, and other parts of the world that the human eye would never observe alone.</p>

          			<p>Technically, the aperture is a small mechanism in a detachable lens, or body of smaller cameras, that determines how much light can pass through to the light sensitive sensor behind it.  It's typically made of 6-8 small "blades" that can create a wide or narrow opening.</p>
          			<p>Artistically, we are interested in the isolation and abundance of light that wide aperture brings, and the endless detail or "ready for anything" sharpness that a narrow aperture can bring</p>

          			<h3><a href="http://www.quincytennyson.com/Portfolio/RNC-2012/i-6gGNFSp/0/XL/TENN7768-XL.jpg">Composition</a></h3>
          			<p>Many tutorials and blogs about photography will fill this final part of the holy photography trinity with information about ISO.  ISO is nearly irrelevant in 2016.  Set it, and forget it.  Unless you're older gear; in that case, look that shit up.</p>

          			<p>Instead we can talk about what makes the photograph worth looking at in the first place: how it is composed.  The Rule of Thirds is a good rule.  It's mean to be broken.  In fac,t the image on the home page is an excellent example of breaking this rule.  While it is, indeed, composed in thirds (2/3 sky, 1/3 mountain), it isn't telling more or less of a story because of it. </p>
